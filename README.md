Using radix sort on decimal numbers â€“ explanation.

When completing your push_swap project you might decide to use radix sort. Check f.e. this tutorial <https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/push-swap-tutorial-fa746e6aba1e> for a detailed explanation how it works. 
Many implementations I have seen so far, use radix sort algorithm by first mapping N decimal numbers into the range [0: N], then turning the numbers into binary and finally by checking the bits whether they are 0 or 1.

I used a different approach, which I describe in this note.

I apply radix sort to the original arguments given as decimal numbers but at the same time I keep in mind how these numbers would look as binary numbers.

Take f.e. decimal 10, in binary system: it would be 1010.

While sorting binary numbers you start from the last digit, you check whether it is 0 (then move it to stack B) or 1 (then you keep it in stack A). When you are done, you continue with the one before the last one digit etc.

How do I apply this to decimal numbers?

I observed the following:

1. The last digit in binary is the reminder (0 or 1) from the division of a decimal number by 2.
2. The one before the last one digit in binary is:
   
   0 if the reminder from the division of a decimal number by 4 is either 0 or 1.
   
   1 if the reminder from the division of a decimal number by 4 is either 2 or 3. 

Just check the following numbers (*% denotes reminder from the division): 

Decimal 4   Reminder 4 % 4 = 0*   Binary 100  
Decimal 5   Reminder 5 % 4 = 1 	  Binary 101  
Decimal 6   Reminder 6 % 4 = 2 	  Binary 110  
Decimal 7   Reminder 7 % 4 = 3 	  Binary 111  
Decimal 8   Reminder 8 % 4 = 0 	  Binary 1000

3. The next digit to the left in binary is 0 if the reminder from the division of a decimal number by 8 is 0, 1, 2 or 3. It is 1 if the reminder is 4, 5,  6 or 7.

Etc.. So there is a pattern. 

Thus my implementation: 

I. Divide a decimal number by 2^digit (when digit = 1 for the last digit, 2 for the second last etc..) 

II. treat the current digit as 0 bit if the reminder falls into interval [0 : (2^digit)/2 - 1] 

III. and as 1 otherwise.

That is very easy to implement, for all digits just do the following:

div = 2^(digit);

(operator ^ is unknown to C, so you need to code it yourself) 

i = 0; 

while (i < size of stack)

{

	reminder = decimal_number % div;

	if (reminder >= 0 && reminder <= ((div / 2) - 1))

		push to stack B

	else

		rotate stack A

	i++;

}

Sorted!
